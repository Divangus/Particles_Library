## Introduction
Welcome to ParticleLib, a C++ static library designed for creating and managing particle systems using OpenGL. This library provides an easy-to-use interface for implementing a variety of particle effects in your projects. Whether you're developing games, simulations, or visual effects, ParticleLib offers the tools you need to bring your particle systems to life.

This library has been developed as a BachelorÂ´s Degree Final Project.

## Download and Implementation Instructions on Visual Studio
- Download the Library from the [Release](https://github.com/Divangus/Particles_Library/releases/tag/ParticleLib) of this project and unzip the file. You can also find an executable containing a demo to showcase the capabilities of the library.
  
- Copy the Files of ParticleLib to your project.
  
- Move the `ParticleVShader.glsl` and `ParticleFShader.glsl` to the WorkingDir of the project.
  
- Once in Visual Studio, open the project properties.
  
- Navigate to C/C++ -> General, and add the directory of the include folder and include/ThirdParty to Additional Include Directories.
  
- Go to Linker -> General and add the path where the ParticleLib.Lib file is located to Additional Library Directories, depending on your version of Visual Studio and your Runtime Library (MT/MTd or MD/MDd).
   - To know what Runtime Library are you using in your program go to C/C++ -> Code Generation. 
  
- Go to Linker -> Input and add "ParticleLib.lib" (without the quotes) to Additional Dependencies.
  
- Finally, include "ParticleLib.h" in your code.
